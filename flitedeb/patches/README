0xxx: Grabbed from upstream development.
1xxx: Possibly relevant for upstream adoption.
2xxx: Only relevant for official Debian release.

The point of the numbered patch naming scheme is for patches targeted
for upstream adoption to not be "infected" by already-upstream or
local-only changes.

The series file can be (re)created with the following command from
within the patches dir (and manually commenting out any disabled
patches afterwards):

    ls -1 0* 1* 2* > series
